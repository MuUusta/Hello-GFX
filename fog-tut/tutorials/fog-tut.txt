In this tutorial we are gonna learn how to add fog to our OpenGl program.

the first thing we need to know is that we need to set a mode that does fog calculations, there are 3 modes that we can use:

	GL_LINEAR
	GL_EXP
	GL_EXP2

we are going to use GL_LINEAR since it gives more realistic fog effect than the others, the other two modes implementation will be provided at the end of the tutorial.

so let's first set our mode:
	glFogi(GL_FOG_MODE, GL_LINEAR);

then we need to specify fog color which is a white/greyish color, since it's not pure white and not pure grey let's set that to 0.6 or 0.7:
	float color[] = {0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1.0};

now we have the variable we only have to set the variable as fog color:
	glFogfv(GL_FOG_COLOR, color);
	Note: "We have to set the glClearColor same as fog color or else you will notice that fog is produced only within the object!"
	glClearColor(0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1.0);

Before enabling fog we need to set start/end points where the fog effect will be taken:
  start point: is the point where the object is at maximum visibility.
  end point : is the point where the object is at minimum visibility (not visible).

	glFogf(GL_FOG_START, 0.0);
    	glFogf(GL_FOG_END, 9.0);

finally, all we need to do is enabling fog:
	glEnable(GL_FOG);

The output should be as in the picture below:
