This tutorial is about blending (Transparency)
since we are still at the ( immediate mode ) tutorials so we are not gonna dive deep into blending for the sake of simplicity
you will get to know all about it as soon as you start the ( retained mode ) tutorials series.

So, first things first, what is blending?

Blending in OpenGL is also commonly known as the technique to implement transparency within objects. Transparency is all about objects (or parts of them) 
not having a solid color, but having a combination of colors from the object itself and any other object behind it with varying intensity. 
A colored glass window is a transparent object; the glass has a color of its own, 
but the resulting color contains the colors of all the objects behind the glass as well. This is also where the name blending comes from since we blend several colors 
(of different objects) to a single color.Transparency thus allows us to see through objects.

let's see how we can implement this

add the following two lines in the init() or wherever you initialize GL properties:

   glColor4f(1.0f,1.0f,1.0f,0.5f);		 
   glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE);

glColor4f(1.0f,1.0f,1.0f,0.5f)
First 3 parameters are for full brightness, the last parameter (0.5) 50% transparent


glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA,GL_ONE)
The glBlendFunc function specifies pixel arithmetic.

Parameters:
-sfactor:
Specifies how the red, green, blue, and alpha source blending factors are computed. The initial value is GL_ONE.

-dfactor:
Specifies how the red, green, blue, and alpha destination blending factors are computed. The following symbolic constants are accepted: 
GL_ZERO, GL_ONE, GL_SRC_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR, GL_DST_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR, GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, GL_DST_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA. 
GL_CONSTANT_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR, GL_CONSTANT_ALPHA, and GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_ALPHA. The initial value is GL_ZERO.

Then we have to tell openGL to turn blending on:
   glEnable(GL_BLEND);

We are done now setting blending and ready to render our scene, Note: don't try to render a complicated scene if you are not fully aware of GL_DEPTH_TEST or how to render objects sorted
from the farthest to the nearst because you might notice some weird output.

press (t) to increase transparency value and (shift+t) to decrease it in this example output.
